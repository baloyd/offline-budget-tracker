This offline budget tracker allows the user to track expenses whether or not they have an internet connection. If the connection is down, the information is cached using indexedDB and facilitated with the help of the service worker. Once the app is back online, the cached information is added to the expense tracker seamlessly.

This app was constructed using HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, IndexedDB, Express.
